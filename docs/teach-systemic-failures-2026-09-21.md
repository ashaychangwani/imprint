# Fresh-teach failure ledger

## Current work

The user requested continued fresh teaches on September 20 (PDT), superseding the
previous campaign stop. The goal is a working four-operation Flights teach and
strict independent audit, followed by an unchanged-code repeat and Hotels validation.
Keep each teach at a 30-minute target, assess at 60 minutes, and enforce 90 minutes.
Audits retain a 45-minute limit. No recurring automation, MR, push or merge.

Current implementation: `2647f8b`; launch revision `b6b8cff` adds only the final
previous-campaign report. A fresh Flights run started September 21 at 05:38:36 UTC
in `~/.imprint/experiments/reteach-systemic-2026-09-21/flights-1/home`, PID 30682.
Target 06:08:36, assessment 06:38:36, hard deadline 07:08:36 UTC. Collector uses
127.0.0.1:6443 and the new campaign's spans.jsonl. Its protobuf export/decode/append
path was tested. Preflight: AC power, 90% battery, about 20 GiB free, original
recordings intact, prior task-owned live work stopped. Implementation and prompts
remain fixed through this teach and audit. No prior generated tools enter teaching.

## How fixes will be selected

Record each failure with its stage, exact private evidence path, artifact/version,
and whether it recurs. Separate a bad generated artifact, bad verification evidence,
orchestration error and external interruption. Reproduce from retained bytes when
possible, apply the smallest general correction, run focused checks, then start a
fresh teach after any implementation/prompt change. Preserve unsuccessful evidence.
An unchanged deterministic failure is not a reason to reroll the whole teach.

The ledger tracks architecture candidates; it is not permission to implement them
all. A suspected issue needs an observed recurrence or a deterministic reproducer
before changing behavior. Agents retain semantic and strategic decisions. Runtime
changes remain mechanical. Existing setup waits, isolation and rate limits stay.

## Recurring failures and current evidence

| ID | Failure | Evidence and status | Smallest next action / trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SF-01 | Prompt examples and machine contracts disagree | September 20 Flights 1: all focused plans omitted required recorded-call metadata. Fixed in f1a0b6a; fresh Flights 2 passed that planning boundary. | Keep schema/example integration coverage. If another contract fails, correct that boundary; do not add site rules. |
| SF-02 | Evidence formatting consumes the verification budget | September 20 Flights 2: escaped citations blocked locations/calendar; hand-built frame decoding exhausted search inspection. Generic decoding, bounded citation repair and a final decision turn were added in 2647f8b. Saved-response and refine checks passed; full teach not yet validated. | Confirm the existing fixes in this fresh run. If repeated, inspect raw decisions before changing budgets. |
| SF-03 | Verification accepts an unrelated live request | September 20 calendar saved-response check passed parser fidelity despite an unnecessary date change. Explicit comparability assessment now rejects it; unchanged location input passes. | Track recorded/live input relationships at planning and review. Repair the selected pair without inventing new cases. |
| SF-04 | Result membership or component identity is lost between raw data and output | Historical Flights 53 duplicated repeated frames; September 20 Flights 2 omitted other result groups and connecting options. Earlier 52 constructed a consumer selection from only part of a composite record. These are confirmed recurring artifact defects, not one universal parsing rule. | Check whether the compiler sees all selected raw bodies and actionable independent feedback. Repair its existing fixed cases; do not prescribe first-frame selection, concatenation, deduplication or a site-specific mapping in runtime. |
| SF-05 | MVP verification and strict audit require different coverage | First isolated refine repair passed its raw checks and two identical calls, but strict audit could not establish the query parameter. Selecting distinct existing recorded queries made repair and extension pass. Focused teach planning already requests distinct recorded calls; effectiveness remains to be observed. | If teach repeats this gap, align case-selection guidance with strict audit using the same fixed recorded set. Preserve unverified coverage rather than weakening the audit. |
| SF-06 | Small metadata changes trigger expensive research again | September 20 Flights 2 repeated booking research after a description/path correction. Code hashes the entire candidate; its workflow includes parameter descriptions. Exact proof binding is useful, but can invalidate more than executable request behavior. One concrete observation; general recurrence not yet established. | Record what changed, which proof was invalidated and elapsed rework. Consider separating execution identity from explanatory metadata only if a reproducer shows needless reproof without weakened semantics. |
| SF-07 | Browser interaction waits dominate despite available evidence | September 20 Flights 1 repeatedly waited about 60 seconds on guessed selectors; historical 48 had missing click targets while result markup existed. There are multiple possible causes, not proof that setup can be skipped. | Inspect navigation/capture/action timestamps and selected conditions. Keep bounded cold-start behavior; change only a reproduced mechanical wait or evidence delivery defect. |

## Code-path observations to test, not established failures

- `verifyRecordingMvp` currently builds every replay fixture for each individual
  live result. A tool with several cases can therefore re-read unrelated fixtures
  and show the reader an asymmetric set of recorded/live sources. Watch for
  unmatched-case rejection or repeated inspection work. A paired-fixture filter
  would be smaller than redesigning verification, but is not implemented without
  evidence that this is blocking the run.
- Recording evidence failures become `revision_required` along the same route as
  bad artifacts. Inspect whether the master repairs the correct component or
  unnecessarily recompiles a correct parser after a proof-only failure. Existing
  citation repair already handles one concrete instance inside the reader.
- The controller copies `.recording-verification` and `.live-checks` into same-run
  repair drafts and resumes the compiler conversation. Confirm the next compiler
  actually reads this evidence; another generic reminder is not automatically a fix.

## Timing baseline

September 20 Flights 2 spent about 39 minutes before all research claims became
proven, 45 minutes before an accepted plan, and 52 before the first compile wave.
It stopped at 64.243 minutes. The critical path includes repeated research and
planning before generated parser checks, not just code generation. Recorded
`compile.generate` spans totaled 555 seconds versus 3,854 seconds elapsed; those
spans overlap other work and cannot be subtracted to attribute the remainder.
`llm.analyze` also includes several agent roles and overlaps, so its total is not
an independent wall-time phase. Warm search reuse was observed previously, but
with different inputs and therefore not a controlled cold/warm benchmark.

The new campaign retains per-role spans, conversation turns, raw failures,
request setup/pacing/call times where emitted, and input/output/cache usage.
Missing measurements are reported as unknown. See the
[previous validation report](teach-reliability-validation-2026-09-20.md) for the
failed baseline, successful isolated refinement and accounting caveats.
