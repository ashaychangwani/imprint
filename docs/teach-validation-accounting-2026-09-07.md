# Teach validation accounting — September 7, 2026

These are the six teaches and three independent audits retained before the fresh validation of implementation `60392ef`. Failed and cancelled attempts remain in the totals. Raw recordings, transcripts, and traces stay outside the repository.

## Recorded results and usage

Elapsed time comes from each completed `cli.teach` or `cli.audit` root span, rather than rounded timeline observations. Input includes cache reads and writes; do not add the cache columns again. All 275 usage spans identify `gpt-5.6-sol`.

| Attempt | Result | Minutes | Total input | Cache read | Cache write | Output | Base API estimate |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Flights teach 1 | Cancelled | 11.50 | 1,692,092 | 998,528 | 0 | 31,780 | $3.81 |
| Flights teach 2 | Cancelled | 73.41 | 17,836,093 | 14,580,352 | 0 | 212,548 | $23.11 |
| Flights teach 3 | 4 ready; audit passed | 69.40 | 13,643,094 | 10,374,272 | 0 | 172,358 | $20.67 |
| Flights audit 3 | 22/22 correct | 7.24 | 679,038 | 645,376 | 0 | 4,201 | $0.48 |
| Hotels teach 1 | 1 ready; audit failed | 17.37 | 3,212,993 | 2,703,872 | 0 | 27,803 | $3.67 |
| Hotels audit 1 | 3/9 correct; 1 excluded bad input | 1.90 | 200,610 | 177,280 | 0 | 1,853 | $0.20 |
| Hotels teach 2 | 1 ready; audit passed | 28.46 | 5,770,208 | 5,150,592 | 0 | 36,521 | $5.27 |
| Hotels audit 2 | 7/7 correct | 2.60 | 177,730 | 151,040 | 0 | 1,430 | $0.20 |
| Flights teach 4 | Failed before planning | 52.40 | 7,896,713 | 6,792,192 | 0 | 98,403 | $9.10 |
| **Total** | **Includes failures/cancellations** | **264.29** | **51,108,571** | **41,573,504** | **0** | **586,897** | **$66.51** |

## Cost assumptions and completeness

The base API estimate uses $4/M uncached input, $0.40/M cached input, $5/M cache writes, and $20/M output from the [official GPT-5.6 Sol model page](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.6-sol), checked September 7, 2026. Formula: `(4 × uncached + 0.4 × cache_read + 5 × cache_write + 20 × output) / 1,000,000`.

This is an API-equivalent estimate, not an invoice or measured Codex subscription charge. The official page specifies higher rates for requests over 272K input tokens. CLI turn/session aggregates do not establish individual request lengths, so the base estimate does not apply that surcharge. Service-tier adjustments, external tool charges, and account-specific pricing are also not established by these traces. No dollar-cost attributes were recorded.

Each span is counted once by trace/span ID. The trace file has no duplicate span IDs within a trace and no token-bearing ancestor of a counted usage span. Compiler and audit CLI usage carriers have no token-bearing children. Workflow spans are excluded. No counted usage is marked estimated.

Five failed `llm.analyze` spans have no reported usage. Cancelled or interrupted provider work may also have consumed unreported tokens; the recorded total is therefore incomplete for such work. Cache writes are zero as emitted by Imprint, which can normalize an absent provider field to zero; this does not independently prove that no cache was written.

The successful Flights teach took 69.40 minutes, above the 30-minute target. The successful narrow Hotels teach took 28.46 minutes. Earlier approximate timeline times include observation delay and are superseded here for process duration. Flights teach 4 failed after 52.40 minutes. These different revisions do not demonstrate repeatability.

## Evidence and remaining work

Source: `/tmp/imprint-fresh-inputs-VYbJm1/spans.jsonl`; extracted local aggregates: `historical-accounting.json` in the same directory. Teach/audit outcomes are detailed in [the handoff](teach-handoff-2026-09-07.md). The historical capture contains 729 spans and nine completed root spans.

Warm API execution and browser setup cannot be recovered reliably from root timing or compiler-agent timing alone. Measure them separately in new live audits, preserving tool/rung state isolation. Record new attempts, fresh producer-consumer results, and independent audit counts before claiming repeatability.
